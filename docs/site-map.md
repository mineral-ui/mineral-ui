Separate pages denoted by a `*`

- Home Page *
  - why another design system?
  - what business problems Mineral solves
  - some glossiness implying we considered design concerns as well as code
- Getting Started *

  - code examples
- Guidelines *
  - Color *
    - ramps
    - usage
    - a11y
    - interactive color chooser

  - Tokens / Theming *
    - style variables

    - establish context/scope of our theming system
- Community / Resources *
  - great place to surface MikeH's research
  - links to Medium posts, twitter
  - cta to join Design System Slack?
  - tone here is that we're not the end-all be-all, but that we want to move the needle w/re to design systems and desire community feedback, or just for people to fork the project or whatever
- Components
  - a page for each component *
  - TODO: Create information hierarchy. There are a lot of individual elements on the components docs. We still have to think through what's most important and should be surfaced. e.g. the component author - probably not important
- Roadmap (What's Next) *

## Notes

Top level nav items will be:
- Getting Started
- Guidelines (links to a table of contents [do we need/want one?])
- Tokens/Theming
- Community
- Components
- Roadmap

A good way to separate ourselves from other design systems might be to create a more educational and interactive experience throughout our docs. Most design system docs are an afterthought, at least from a technical perspective. Some are pretty, but quite static. We could establish a degree of trust with the audience if we tried to create an informative and holistic experience instead of being Yet Another Design System.
