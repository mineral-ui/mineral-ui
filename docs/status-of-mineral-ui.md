# Status of Mineral UI

Mineral UI was created by CA Technologies to solve specific problems within our software ecosystem, which are reflected in this project's values. In November 2018, CA Technologies was bought by Broadcom, Inc and those problems — and, by extension, this project — were no longer a priority for the company. As a result, and to our chagrin, the time we could spend on Mineral UI quickly diminished to almost nothing.

We had hoped that situation might change after the initial shock of acquisition, and we would be able to focus on this project again. We truly loved the work, and felt we were providing a helpful resource to the community. But, after a year, we must let go of that hope and be upfront about where things stand.

Therefore, we see two possible paths forward:

1. Hand off the project to other maintainers
    - Please contact us at mineral-ui-team@ca.com if you are interested
    - We are happy to provide help and guidance, particularly as you are getting started
2. Archive the project

We would also like to point you toward some alternative projects that we believe to be comparable to Mineral UI.


## Alternatives

If you would like to explore an alternative to Mineral UI, we have vetted these libraries, with criteria of accessibility (a11y), extensibility, performance, and community.

- [Base Web][] — Extraordinarily customizable via [theming][] and the [`overrides`][overrides] prop; uses [styletron][]
- [Chakra][] — Built on [Styled System][], so one-off styles are super easy; uses [emotion][], like Mineral UI
- [Reach UI][], [Reakit][] — Focused on a11y; unstyled, so good for building your own component library
- [Material UI][] — They have made huge improvements in all areas since the creation of Mineral UI, and they continue to enjoy a robust community of support


## Thank you

We would also simply like to thank everyone who used Mineral UI or contributed in any way, be that submitting an issue, suggesting a feature, designing components, writing code or reviewing PRs.
