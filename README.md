# [Mineral UI](https://mineral-ui.com/)

A design system and [React](https://reactjs.org/) component library for the web that lets you quickly build high-quality, accessible apps. Created by [CA Technologies](http://ca.com).

## Project Goals

- Consistent, thoughtful design
- Accessible and inclusive
- Performant
- Responsive
- Powerful and easy to develop with inside your app


## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the [Mineral UI package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mineral-ui) and
its dependencies.

```bash
npm install --save mineral-ui emotion emotion-theming react-emotion react react-dom
```

or

```bash
yarn add mineral-ui emotion emotion-theming react-emotion react react-dom
```


### Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import Button from 'mineral-ui/Button';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'mineral-ui/themes';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Button>
        Hello World
      </Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

> Your app must be wrapped in a [ThemeProvider](https://mineral-ui.com/components/theme-provider/) at its root in order for the styles to apply correctly.

> Also, please see our [import syntax guidelines](https://mineral-ui.com/import-syntax).


### Open Sans Font

Mineral UI was designed around [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans). To get the components to look right, you will need to include this font in your project yourself or our styles will fall back to system fonts. To quickly include this font in your app, copy this code into the `<head>` of your HTML document.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:300,300i,400,400i,600,600i,700,700i,800,800i" rel="stylesheet">
```

For more options loading this font from Google, check out the Selected Family popup, in the [specimen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans). You can also download the font file and serve it yourself if you'd like, but we'll leave that to you.


### Styling

This project uses CSS-in-JS and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for component styling. Refer to the [styling page](https://mineral-ui.com/styling/) for details.
