Mineral UI provides a simple set of typographic elements to easily apply structure to your interface.
Using consistent typographic styles will create clear paths for users to move through your application.

## Font Usage

Mineral UI uses [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans), a humanist sans-serif typeface with good legibility and warmth.
Featuring a tall x-height and open forms, it is ideal for on-screen consumption.
Open Sans supports ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets.

For Internationalization, support is included for RTL (right-to-left) languages. Asian Syllabic, Abjad, Indic and other script languages will be supported by sans-serif system font.

## Type Sizing

Consistent application of typography helps the user understand information hierarchy.
- Type sizing is based on a [typescale](http://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/).
- Type basis defines `16px` as `1rem`.
- Type sizing is based on a `1.25` (4:5 Major-Third) scale. This ratio balances vertical density with an expression of clear hierarchy.
- The root base (default text size) is `14px`.

## Relative Line Spacing

Linespacing is consistently set at `1.25` for all type sizes, except for prose text, which has a line height of `1.5` to increase readability for long-form text.

## Hierarchy and Intent

Consistency is key to creating an easily scannable interface for users.
Each level in the Mineral UI type hierarchy is defined with a specific color and intent.
Associating the typographic style to the intent in the interface provides a visual pattern that is easy for users to skim.

The variations help keep type styles to a minimum, so consistency is easier to achieve. Too many type styles make a layout unbalanced and difficult to manage.
