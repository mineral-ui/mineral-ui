# Theming

Theming is a core concept in Mineral UI.
Themes provide a consistent look and feel across pages with varied functionality.
Mineral UI makes it simple to implement and maintain theming across your app.

The theme system is flexible enough to be applied globally or at a component level.
This page lists of all Mineral UI theme variables for your reference.


## Implementation

Consider the signature of [createStyledComponent](/components/utils#create-styled-component):

```jsx
const MyComponent = createStyledComponent('div', props => ({
  backgroundColor: props.theme.color_primary
}));
```

The [ThemeProvider](/components/theme-provider)(s) in
your app provides the theme to other Mineral UI and/or Glamorous
components within that ThemeProvider. Your app
[must have a ThemeProvider at its root](/getting-started) and can
optionally nest additional ThemeProviders to apply a custom theme to sections
of your app. Nested ThemeProviders shallowly merge their theme
with the parent theme.

The theme itself (see the default mineral theme below for an example) is
a simple shallow object of variables that are shared across components.

Each component can also have a “theme”, which is not a file, but rather
a set of variables available to override default values. E.g., if
Mineral UI’s [Button](/components/button) component looked like this:

```jsx
const Button = createStyledComponent('button', props => ({
  color: props.theme.Button_color || props.theme.color_primary
}));
```

The themes distributed as part of Mineral UI include a value for
`color_primary` but do not include a value for `Button_color`. In
our component code, we leave the component-level variable
`Button_color` as a hook for you to define if you’d like.
Component-level theme variables start with the capitalized component
name to differentiate from the global variables. When you’d like to
override the Mineral UI theme at a component level in your app, you can
use [createThemedComponent](/components/utils#create-themed-component):

```jsx
const MyButton = createThemedComponent(Button, {
  Button_color: 'tomato'
});
```

## Theme Variables

Themes in Mineral UI are made of the following variables. The values
below come from the default mineral theme. Note the naming convention:
‘property_target_variant_state’.
