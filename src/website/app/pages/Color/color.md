Mineral UI color provides themes built on inspiring hues and grounded in usable grays.
Mineral UI is committed to providing an easy path to creating accessible palettes and themes.

## Guidelines

Color is used to establish focal points or highlight important information.
Mineral UI uses color as a tool for communication and secondarily as decoration.
Overuse of color will overload the viewer and undermine any effect it had in creating a visual hierarchy.

Take care when overriding individual theme values, since they enable consistent styling through automatic application of tone and shadowing.

## Themes

A **theme** is composed of a hue color ramp and the base gray ramp. Every theme uses the base gray ramp.

You can create your own theme:
  - `<value>_60` represents the base color for the theme.
  - Hue ramps are generated from 10 points placed on a Bezier curve with 3 anchors.
  - The top point represents `<value>_10`.
  - The middle point represents `<value>_60`.
  - The final point represents `<value>_100`.
  - Each value is evenly distributed. Some manual adjustment might be necessary.
  - Depending on the mood and tone for the theme, some curves are steeper and some more shallow. The theme will appear brighter and more saturated with shallower curves.

## Variants

**Variants** are used in Mineral UI to aid users' understanding of the status of different callouts, actions, buttons etc.

The color system features three variants to represent intention:
- **Success:** confirming actions or messages that were successful, or will begin a successful action.
- **Warning:** actions or messages that indicate a warning or may produce an undesirable result.
- **Destructive:** actions or messages that indicate errors or potential to destroy/remove data.

## Accessibility

Always consider customers who have different accessibility (a11y) needs, e.g. those who are color blind or visually impaired, when choosing colors.
Color ramp values have similar accessibility values even when themes are switched out.

Most themes are [WCAG AA+](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) accessible. If a higher level of accessibility is required, allow the user to activate an accessible theme as a user preference.

**AA** has a contrast level of 4.5:1 or higher, and **AAA** has a contrast of at least 7:1.
**AA Large** means the font size must be at least [18 points or 14 points bolded](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/05/whats-large-text-in-wcag-2-0-parlance/) to be AA accessible.

## Ramps

You can choose one of these ramps to create a theme.
The default Mineral UI theme is built from "blue".
