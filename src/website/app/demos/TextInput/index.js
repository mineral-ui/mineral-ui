      <p>
        Unlike most other components, which apply undocument properties to the
        root element, TextInput applies undocumented properties to the{' '}
        <em>input</em>.

    whenHowToUse: `Use a TextInput to accept brief, free-form input from a user.

TextInputs should always have an associated label for accessibility and so the
user knows what information to provide. See [FormField](../form-field).

Be specific when choosing the \`type\` for your TextInput. Mobile devices will
display different keyboards depending on the input type.

Provide [additional attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#Attributes)
to aid frictionless interaction with your forms. E.g. \`autocorrect="off"\` on
an input accepting a user's name.`
