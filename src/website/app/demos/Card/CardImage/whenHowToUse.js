export default `CardImage is used when you want to reinforce the intent of the
Card. Images shouldn't be used alone in a Card, but should be paired with a
call to action and/or a [CardTitle](/components/card-title).

If you are putting text over top of the CardImage, use a solid color or an image
with sufficient contrast to the text.`;
