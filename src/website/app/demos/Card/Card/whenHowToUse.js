export default `Cards are used when you need to group different kinds of
elements with actions attached. Cards are used to contain content of variable
length that might not fit neatly into a table row or grid cell. They're often
used to show a collection of related but different types of information.

Don't put too much information in a single card.
Cards represent a gateway to more detailed information in another app view.`;
