export default `GridItem, together with [Grid](/components/grid),
provides an easy way to align components to a columnar layout. With optionally
responsive properties, it is powerful and flexible enough to be the foundation
of your app's layout.

GridItem is a simpler version of [FlexItem](/components/flex-item), with the
ability to set widths equal to column spans. If you need more flexibility for
your layout, or you do not need to align to a columnar layout, use FlexItem
instead.`;
