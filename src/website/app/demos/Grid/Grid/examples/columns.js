in conjunction with [GridItem's \`span\` prop](/components/grid-item#span).

_In the illustration below, the first and third rows contain identical
GridItems. But the first row has \`columns\` set to 15, while the third uses the
default of 12. Therefore, the GridItem that spans 7 columns lines up nicely in
the first row (15 - 7 = 8, which is neatly divided into two for the remaining
"auto" GridItems), but does not in the third (12 - 7 = 5, which does not neatly
divide into 2)._`,
