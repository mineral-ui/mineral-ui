export default `Grid, together with [GridItem](/components/grid-item),
provides an easy way to align components to a columnar layout. With configurable
gutters, alignment options, and optionally responsive properties, it is powerful
and flexible enough to be the foundation of your app's layout.

Grid is a simpler version of [Flex](/components/flex), with the ability to set
the number of columns used when calculating item widths. If you need more
flexibility for your layout, or you do not need to align to a columnar layout,
use Flex instead.`;
