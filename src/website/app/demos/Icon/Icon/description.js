export default `Icons use graphical symbols to represent an object or concept in
your UI. They can be used to aid comprehension of core actions in your app, and
to provide feedback for user input.

The Icon component allows you to use your own SVG to easily create an icon.

In addition to the generic Icon component, Mineral UI provides a large number of
pre-built Icon components, available separately in the
[mineral-ui-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mineral-ui-icons) package.`;
