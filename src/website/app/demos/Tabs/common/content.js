  malachite: `Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral, with the formula
  Cu2CO3(OH)2. This opaque, green banded mineral crystallizes in the
  monoclinic crystal system, and most often forms botryoidal, fibrous,
  or stalagmitic masses, in fractures and spaces, deep underground,
  where the water table and hydrothermal fluids provide the means for
  chemical precipitation.`,
  fluorite: `Fluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium
  fluoride, CaF2. It belongs to the halide minerals. It crystallizes
  in isometric cubic habit, although octahedral and more complex
  isometric forms are not uncommon. The Mohs scale of mineral
  hardness, based on scratch hardness comparison, defines value 4 as
  Fluorite. Fluorite is a colorful mineral, both in visible and
  ultraviolet light, and the stone has ornamental and lapidary uses.
  Industrially, fluorite is used as a flux for smelting, and in the
  production of certain glasses and enamels. The purest grades of
  fluorite are a source of fluoride for hydrofluoric acid manufacture,
  which is the intermediate source of most fluorine-containing fine
  chemicals.`,
  magnetite: `Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the
  chemical formula Fe3O4. It is one of the oxides of iron, and is
  ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to
  become a permanent magnet itself. It is the most magnetic of all the
  naturally-occurring minerals on Earth. Naturally-magnetized
  pieces of magnetite, called lodestone, will attract small pieces of
  iron, which is how ancient peoples first discovered the property of
  magnetism. Today it is mined as iron ore. Small grains of magnetite
  occur in almost all igneous and metamorphic rocks.`
