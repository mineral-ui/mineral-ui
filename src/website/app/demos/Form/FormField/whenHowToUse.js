export default `Wrap each input in your app with a FormField for appropriate
accessibility and styling.

Labels should be short (1-3 words) and indicate the type of input requested.
Labels are not meant to explain the intent of the form as a whole.

Placeholder text is not a replacement for labels.

Do not use an asterisk in labels for required fields; use the \`required\` prop
instead.

Error text should be short and concise, telling the user how to fix the problem.`;
