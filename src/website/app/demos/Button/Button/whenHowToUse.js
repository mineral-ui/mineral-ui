export default `A Button should be used whenever you need to trigger an action
in your app. Buttons should have concise labeling indicating to your user what
will happen when the Button is clicked. The color of the button should be
chosen according to the intent of the action.

For example, if clicking a Button will make a potentially destructive action,
use \`variant="danger"\` instead of \`"success"\`.`;
