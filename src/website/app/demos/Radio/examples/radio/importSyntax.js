<Callout title="Note">
  Mineral UI also provides a <a href="../radio-group" key={0}>RadioGroup</a>,
  which offers a simpler API for working with a group of Radios, and
  a <a href="../form-field" key={1}>FormField</a> to provide an accessible label
  and other features. Examples here omit RadioGroups and FormFields for clarity
  and brevity.
