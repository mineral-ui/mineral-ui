<Callout title="Note">
  Mineral UI also provides a <a href="../checkbox-group" key={0}>CheckboxGroup</a>,
  which offers a simpler API for working with a group of Checkboxes, and
  a <a href="../form-field" key={1}>FormField</a> to provide an accessible label
  and other features. Examples here omit CheckboxGroup and FormFields for
  clarity and brevity.
