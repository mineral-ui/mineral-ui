export default `A Menu should be used whenever you need to display a concise
list of options to your user. Think through the consequenses of the actions in
your Menu. If there are potentially destructive actions exposed, be sure to use
the correct [variants](/color#color-variants) to provide a hint to the user
about what will happen after picking an option.

Labels should have clear messaging in the form of \`<verb> <noun>\`, if possible.`;
