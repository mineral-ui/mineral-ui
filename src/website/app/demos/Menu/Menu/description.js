export default `A Menu presents a list of options representing actions or
navigation. Composed of [MenuItems](/components/menu-item), Menu is usually
combined with [Popover](/components/popover) to create a
[Dropdown](/components/dropdown).

Menus are great for collecting actions in one place so your users don't need to
scan the entire document to find a feature.`;
