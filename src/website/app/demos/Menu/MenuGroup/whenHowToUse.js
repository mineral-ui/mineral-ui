export default `MenuGroups are used to group conceptually related elements, and
to hint at other available, related options. If the intention of the grouping is
not immediately obvious, add a section title via the \`title\` prop to aid in
your users' decision-making process.

If there are only a few elements in a couple of groups, and the grouping logic
is obvious, consider using a [MenuDivider](/components/menu-divider) instead.`;
