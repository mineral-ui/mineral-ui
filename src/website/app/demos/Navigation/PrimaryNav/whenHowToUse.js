export default `Mineral supports several different types of navigation. The
correct navigation component should be selected based on your application's
information architecture.

PrimaryNav is for top-level lateral navigation, where the user would be moving
between two or more destinations at the top level of the application hierarchy.
This component should allow the user to navigate to all of the main sections
within the application. It can be used in conjunction with all other navigation
types.

PrimaryNav can also be used to navigate between suites of products, if another
in-app navigation method is also present in each of the individual products.`;
