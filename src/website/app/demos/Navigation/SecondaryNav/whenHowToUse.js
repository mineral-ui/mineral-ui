export default `Mineral supports several different types of navigation. The
correct navigation component should be selected based on your applicationâ€™s
information architecture.

SecondaryNav is for second or third level lateral navigation, where the user
would be moving between two or more destinations at the same level of the
application hierarchy. This component should allow the user to navigate within a
section of the application hierarchy. It can be used in conjunction with all
other navigation types.

SecondaryNav has two display types: pills and tabs. Use pills to represent view
navigation where the number of items does not change for a given section. Use
tabs type to represent document-based navigation, where the number of navigation
items could vary for a given section.`;
